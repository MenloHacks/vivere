# MenloHacks Vivere
### Introduction
MenloHacks Vivere is the backend system for all day-of-operations.
It is written in Python using the Flask framework and uses MongoDB for its datastore. Note that Vivere is currently a work in progress and certain things are not finalized yet or secure.

All endpoints are relative to `api.menlohacks.com` and for endpoints that require
authorization the authorization token should be placed in the `X-MenloHacks-Authorization` field.

All parameters should be end in the body of POST requests formatted as JSON
(with content-type application/json) and all parameters for GET requests should
be included in the URL.

This document will be updated as new endpoints are created or as API specs change.

### Model
Every time an object is retrieved from the server, it will be represented as a JSON object.
Each JSON object will be uniform across the system by object type for uniform JSON parsing.
